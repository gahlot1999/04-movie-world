Sure! As a client, I would like to provide you with detailed requirements for the Movie Library App challenge.

Project Name: Movie Library App

1. Setup:
   - Create a new React application using create-react-app or your preferred setup.
   - Use a package manager like npm or yarn to install dependencies.

2. Redux Implementation:
   - Configure Redux in the application to manage the global state.
   - Use Redux middleware like thunk or Redux-Saga for handling asynchronous actions.
   - Create separate reducers for managing different parts of the application state (e.g., movies, search results, loading, errors).
   - Define action creators for fetching movie data, setting loading state, handling errors, etc.

3. API Service Module:
   - Implement a separate API service module to interact with the movie database API.
   - Since the movie database API doesn't support POST requests, implement only the GET methods for fetching data.
   - Create functions to fetch popular movies and movie details from the API.
   - Handle errors and unexpected responses gracefully.

4. User Interface:
   - Design a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for the Movie Library App.
   - Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI to style the UI components.
   - Create a responsive layout that looks great on various devices.

5. Routing:
   - Implement advanced routing using React Router or any other preferred routing library.
   - Set up routes for the home page, movie details page, and search page.
   - Configure route parameters for displaying details of a specific movie.

6. Home Page:
   - On the home page, display a list of popular movies fetched from the movie database API.
   - Show movie titles, release years, and poster images for each movie.
   - Clicking on a movie should navigate to its details page.

7. Movie Details Page:
   - Implement a movie details page to display additional information about a selected movie.
   - Show details such as the movie's plot, rating, genre, cast, and any other relevant information available from the API.
   - Include a back button to navigate back to the home page.

8. Search Page:
   - Create a search page where users can search for movies by title.
   - Implement a search input field and a search button to trigger the search.
   - Display the search results as a list of movie cards similar to the home page.

9. Loading and Error Handling:
   - Implement loading spinners or placeholders while waiting for the movie data to be fetched from the API.
   - Handle errors gracefully and show appropriate error messages when API requests fail or return empty data.

10. Pagination (Optional):
   - Implement pagination on the home page and search results page to limit the number of movies shown per page.
   - Allow users to navigate through different pages of movie results.

11. Client-Side Caching (Bonus):
   - Use Redux Persist or any other preferred client-side caching solution to store fetched movie data locally.
   - Reduce redundant API requests by fetching data from the cache when available.

12. Animations and Transitions (Bonus):
   - Add subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.
   - Use animations when navigating between pages or displaying loading states.

13. Custom Hooks (Bonus):
   - Create custom hooks for data fetching to improve code reusability and maintainability.

14. Responsiveness:
   - Ensure that the application is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes and devices.

15. Testing (Optional):
   - Write unit tests for critical components and Redux actions/reducers using testing libraries like Jest and Enzyme.

Remember to frequently commit your code to a version control system like Git and provide clear documentation on how to run the application locally. Feel free to ask for any clarifications or additional requirements if needed. Good luck with the challenge!
